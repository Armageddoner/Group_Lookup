# Program Intents

This program is intended to act as a means to view a ROBLOX group's information from within your terminal. This program shows basic information regarding the ROBLOX group ID you input.

# Known issues

* Group shouts will ALWAYS appear as **None**
    * This is a problem on the API's side.

 
## Getting a Group ID

ROBLOX uses a numeric system for group identification.
(e.g., https://www.roblox.com/communities/15166696/Crimson-Exit#!/about)
The numbers you see within the URL are the ID, and thus, may be copied.

Alternatively, you can type random integers and see what comes up!
